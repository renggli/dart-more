/// Generates the [normal output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Usage)
/// format of `diff`.
///
/// In this format, `a` stands for added, `d` for deleted and `c` for changed.
/// Line numbers of the original file appear before a/d/c and those of the new
/// file appear after. The less-than and greater-than signs (at the beginning
/// of lines that are added, deleted or changed) indicate which file the lines
/// appear in. Addition lines are added to the original file to appear in the
/// new file. Deletion lines are deleted from the original file to be missing
/// in the new file.
///
/// By default, lines common to both files are not shown. Lines that have moved
/// are shown as added at their new location and as deleted from their old
/// location.
