- Graph algorithms
  - **Path and Circuit Algorithms**
    - Hamiltonian path/circuit detection
      - NP-complete: backtracking or DP with bitmasks
      - Returns path if exists
  - **Structural Analysis**
    - Graph isomorphism detection
      - VF2 algorithm for general graphs
      - Include subgraph isomorphism
    - Articulation points (cut vertices) and bridges
      - Tarjan's algorithm with low-link values
      - Critical for network resilience analysis
    - Planar graph testing
      - Boyer-Myrvold algorithm or Kuratowski's theorem
      - Could provide planar embedding
  - **Distance and Centrality**
    - Graph diameter and radius
      - Use Floyd-Warshall results
      - Find center vertices (min eccentricity)
    - Degree centrality measures
      - Betweenness centrality (shortest paths through vertex)
      - Closeness centrality (sum of distances)
      - Eigenvector centrality / PageRank
  - **Graph Properties**
    - Graph density (simple ratio calculation)
    - Clustering coefficient
    - Average path length
    - Assortativity (degree correlation)
  - **Matching and Covering**
    - Maximum matching
      - Bipartite: Hopcroft-Karp or Hungarian algorithm
      - General: Blossom algorithm (Edmonds)
    - Minimum vertex cover / Maximum independent set
      - Bipartite: König's theorem
      - General: approximation algorithms
  - **Community and Decomposition**
    - Community detection / Graph partitioning
      - Louvain method, label propagation, or Girvan-Newman
    - k-Core decomposition
      - Iteratively remove low-degree vertices
      - Useful for dense subgraph finding
  - **Connectivity**
    - Vertex connectivity and edge connectivity
      - Use max-flow min-cut theorem
      - Minimum vertices/edges to disconnect graph
  - **Graph Transformations**
    - Transitive closure and reduction
      - Closure: add all implied edges
      - Reduction: remove redundant edges
      - Useful for dependency graphs
